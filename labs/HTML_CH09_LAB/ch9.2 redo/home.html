<p>The Apple I was released in 1976 for a diabolical price of $666.66.
     While this price put conspiracy theorists in a spin, the truth behind it is far more mundane. 
    Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has repeatedly asserted
     that the price is anything but evil, and that he simply 
     liked repeating digits.</p></div>
<div class="column"><p>When people think of Apples greatest hits, 
    the iPhone and iPad come to mind. Most people
     might not know that Apple had a brief foray 
     into the fashion world in 1986 with the release of 
     its clothing line “The Apple Collection.”

    A far cry from Apples well-known minimalist aesthetic, 
    the line included branded clothing, accessories, and lifestyle 
    items splattered in bright colors and bold patterns.</p></div>
     
<div class="column"> <p>Apple marched into 2022 as the first company to reach a $3 trillion market value,
    having previously broken records by becoming the first company with a $1 trillion and $2 trillion market cap.
     In addition to this already impressive headline, Apples market cap is larger than all countries except four—the United States, China, Japan, and Germany.

   That means, if Apple were a country, it would be wealthier than almost every country, including major powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and India.</p></div>
